# Project Development

On the Hippo Forge, projects are maintained by Hippo. Hippo will not give push rights to external developers. 

## Code Contributions
On GitHub, code contributions exist in the form of pull requests. External organisations can always drive those pull 
requests, or feature requests, or release requests by contacting our services department.

### Forking
Forking into other (non-Hippo) GitHub locations is of course a possibility for further development on behalf of your 
project as well. In fact, a fork is the starting point of a pull request!

## Branching strategy
TODO  git flow
 

### Artifact Repository
Hippo Maven Repository at [maven.onehippo.com/maven2/](http://maven.onehippo.com/maven2/org/onehippo/forge/)

Maybe later we'll move to Maven Central.
