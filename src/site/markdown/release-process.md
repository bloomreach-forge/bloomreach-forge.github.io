## Release Process

We recommend release processes using ```git-flow``` in Hippo Forge projects because it is easier for most people
to understand and follow and also widely accepted.

The recommended instructions are based on ```git-flow```. Please follow available references of ```git-flow``` like the following:

- http://danielkummer.github.io/git-flow-cheatsheet/
- https://gitversion.readthedocs.io/en/latest/git-branching-strategies/gitflow-examples/
- http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/

Basically, there are two different instructions. One is for the standard release process based on the latest
development working branch, and the other is for the maintenance release process based on older version support branches.
