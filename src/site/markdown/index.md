## Welcome!

Welcome to the **Hippo Forge on GitHub**, the community place for plugins, add-ons and extensions built on top of Hippo 
CMS or Hippo DX.

_Community plugins are maintained by the Hippo community and by implementation projects._ <br/>
For instance, it is common for a plugin upgrade to be triggered by a project upgrade.

### The projects
See [the project list page](project-list.html) for an overview of all projects at hosted at [github.com/onehippo-forge]
(https://github.com/onehippo-forge).

Initially, 33 selected projects were migrated in March 2017 from the discontinued Hippo SVN Forge at [forge.onehippo.org]
(https://forge.onehippo.org).

**URL Rewriter exception**  
The URL Rewriter plugin has been so successful that it has migrated to [Hippo GitLab](https://code.onehippo.org/cms-community/hippo-plugin-urlrewriter)
instead of GitHub.

### Development
See [the development page](development.html) for some standards regarding developing a plugin project. There is also a
[quality checklist](checklist.html). 

### Archived SVN projects
The discontinued Hippo SVN Forge has been archived in the [Hippo SVN attic](http://svn.onehippo.org/repos/hippo/attic/forge/).
