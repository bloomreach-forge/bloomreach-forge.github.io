## Welcome!

Welcome to the **Hippo Forge on GitHub**, the community place for plugins, add-ons and extensions built on top of Hippo 
CMS.

_Community plugins are maintained by the Hippo community and by implementation projects._ <br/>
For instance, it is common for a plugin upgrade to be triggered by a project upgrade.

### The projects
See [the project list page](project-list.html) for an overview of all projects at hosted at [github.com/onehippo-forge]
(https://github.com/onehippo-forge).

Initially, in March 2017, 33 selected projects were migrated to GitHub from the discontinued Hippo SVN Forge 
at [forge.onehippo.org] (https://forge.onehippo.org).

### Development
See [the development page](development.html) for some standards regarding developing a plugin project. There is also a
[quality checklist](checklist.html).
