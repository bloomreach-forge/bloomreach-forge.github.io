## Welcome!

Welcome to the **BloomReach Forge on GitHub**, the community place for plugins, add-ons and extensions built on top of 
BloomReach Experience Manager, formerly known as Hippo CMS.

_Community plugins are maintained by the BloomReach community and by implementation projects._ <br/>
For instance, it is common for a plugin upgrade to be triggered by a project upgrade.

### The projects
See [the project list page](project-list.html) for an overview of all projects at hosted at [github.com/bloomreach-forge]
(https://github.com/bloomreach-forge).

Initially, in March 2017, 33 active projects were migrated to GitHub from the discontinued Hippo SVN Forge 
at forge.onehippo.org (now redirected here).

### Development
See [the development page](development.html) for some standards regarding developing a plugin project. The preferred 
branching model is explained in [using git flow](using-git-flow.html). There is also a [quality checklist](checklist.html).
